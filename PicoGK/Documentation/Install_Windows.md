## Next: Installing Visual Studio

Next you have to decide, whether you want to use **Visual Studio 2022**, or **Visual Studio Code**. 

**Visual Studio 2022** Is the easier-to-use product, we recommend using it on Windows.

**Visual Studio Code** is the cross platform integrated development environment for macOS, Windows and LINUX. It's a bit harder to use, but if you switch between macOS and Windows frequently, it's a good choice.

- [Install Visual Studio 2022](VisualStudio_FirstTime.md) (recommended)

- [Install Visual Studio Code](VisualStudioCode_FirstTime.md)
